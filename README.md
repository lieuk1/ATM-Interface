# ATM Interface Project
A simple ATM Interface project to practice C++ skills. This is also the first project I've uploaded to GitHub (Git CMD).

## How To Run via Command Line
1. Download .cpp and .h files from GitHub
2. In command line: \
`cd project_path_folder` \
`g++ atm_class.cpp atm_main.cpp -o atm_main.exe` \
`atm_main.exe`

### Project-Specific Skills
- C++ classes
- Reading/writing binary files
- Variable error checking using while loops
